        <p>SEPTEMBER 2023</p>

        <h2 class="features">Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Added an attack helicopter specifically designed to decimate solo players for no reason (it can
                rapid
                fire rockets) - Because nothing says "welcome to Rust" like an insurmountable obstacle
                specifically engineered to ruin your day. Let's face it, solo players were having it too easy, right?
            </li>
            <li>Added a homing missile launcher to combat these attack helicopters for the low price of several
                thousand
                manually farmed scrap - Good news! For those who have the time and patience to grind for
                hours on
                end, or perhaps have a masochistic streak, we've introduced a countermeasure that's almost as ridiculous
                as the
                problem it solves.</li>
            <li>Added pay-to-win weapon racks targeted towards roaming clans for only $24.99 - Finally,
                the
                true essence of skill-based gameplay can be unlocked for less than the price of a decent meal. Your
                financial
                contribution allows you to bypass the very mechanics that make this game challenging, all while annoying
                the
                rest of the community. What's not to love?</li>
            <li>Added the "Indigo" wire color option</li>
        </ul>
